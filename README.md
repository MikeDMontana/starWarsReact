<h1>Don't forget to npm install</h1>

<h1>Notes on overhaul</h1>
<p> Once I got Austin's code along project working again I copy/ pasted Ed's axios call into it then debugged it<br>
unitl it ran. I had to npm install axios, and import it in using the es6 syntax. After that , I played with the axiosbr>
call until I understood it a little better, then returned the people instead.</p>

<h3>About the console error</h3>
<p>I just don't have my css properly linked yet</p>
